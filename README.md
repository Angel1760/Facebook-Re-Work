# Facebook-Re-Work
The goal with this project is to make Facebook (now rebranded as META) user friendlier to the consumers that feel it was too cluttered with the new features it continuously adds. For lack of a better term, its main purpose is to socialize with friends, family, and explore pages.

This was a group collaboration project for a Software Engineering course I took during my undergrad studies. Credit to the group is:
